# Teststats

Test (history) analysis in a codebase.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'teststats'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teststats

## Usage

    cd <your git repository root directory>
    teststats count

instructions:

    teststats

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake false` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
